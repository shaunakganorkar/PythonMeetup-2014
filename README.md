# PythonMeetup-2014
I had attended a Python Meetup in December 2014. The core idea of it was to introduce the people to learn python language and hence the first meetup was designed to teach beginners python. I had wished to learn python but had no idea from where to start hence I decided why not join (it was free ! Plus Lunch was on them ;) ).) 

Following are the programs listed that were taught. I am sharing my source code. Feel free to suggest or comment !
